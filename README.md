# Hello there!

This is my fullstack application - social network named Coorlyker. Once you sign up, you can fill out a profile with information about yourself, find and subscribe to your friends, watch other users' posts and create your own, put reactions to them and write comments. You can also create a meeting and invite your friends to it. Enjoy using and subscribe to me, my nickname is **bxr1nG**!

### Application stack:
Client side: React.js, MaterialUI, Redux Toolkit, Redux Saga, React Router, Formik, Yup;
Server side: Node.js, Express.js, Joi, Multer.

##### There are a few bugs in the public version at the moment:
- Getting an error when changing the URL
- Unable to change the account avatar
- Unable to create a post with a picture

##### Upcoming updates:
- Connecting external storage for pictures
- Optimizing images to reduce storage space
- Fixing the URL issue by making changes to the React Router implementation
- Optimizing the server side of the application by switching to TypeScript
- Optimizing requests to the server through Redux Saga
- Creating a mobile version of the app
- Possibly migrating to another hosting service

I'll add screenshots of the project here a little later :)
